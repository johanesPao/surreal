Before we dwelve into arrays formulas in Excel, we need to talk about some of the
more basic stuff, like what is an array? why would we need it in excel? is array a
new features in excel? does it important to learn about it? and how does it work?

## What is an Array?

First, we need to talk about what most people in the world of programming addressed
as _variable_, it's a bit off-track, but I'll try my best to keep it short. A variable
is like a box with a label on it. You can store something inside of the box and label
the box. And whenever you need to retrieve something, you can go find the box with the
right label on it.<br/>
Now, a box may contain one thing like a wedding ring or it could contain many things
like a box with "Kitchen Stuffs" label on it. When a box, contains more than one thing,
we can consider it as an array. To give a glimpse of what a variable with single value
looks like and what a variable array looks like, in _javascript_ it looks like this:

<br />
<SyntaxHighlight
  bahasa='javascript'
  kode={`const weddingRingBox = "wedding ring";
const kitchenStuffsBox = ["Spoon", "Fork", "Oven", "Knife"];`}
/>
<br />
In excel, assuming we store the value of variable `weddingRingBox` in **A1** and
`kitchenStuffsBox` in **A2**, this can be represented as follows:
<br />
<SyntaxHighlight
  bahasa='xlsx'
  kode={`="wedding ring"
={"Spoon","Fork","Oven","Knife"}`}
/>
<br />
In Excel, it looks like this:
<br />

  }
  caption={"Cell with single value in A1 and array in A2"}
/>
<br />
Notice the _curly braces_ and some kind of _thin border_ that wraps the cells in
range **A2:D2**? A bit different with how we define an array in programming using
_square brackets_, in Excel, an array is define using _curly braces_ instead. As
for the _thin border_ that can be seen in picture above? It is only showing when
the active cell is in the range of **A2:D2**, which is the _SPILL_ area of the array
(more about spill later on)

## Do We Need Array?

That would depends on the case you're working on. If you are being demanded to
work on something fast, aestethics and reusability won't be your priority, so you can
sketch away with Excel and get everything done.
