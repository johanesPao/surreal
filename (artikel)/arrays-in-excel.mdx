Before we dwelve into arrays formulas in Excel, we need to talk about some of the
more basic stuff, like what is an array? why would we need it in excel? is array a
new features in excel? does it important to learn about it? and how does it work?

## What is an Array?

First, we need to talk about what most people in the world of programming addressed
as _variable_, it's a bit off-track, but I'll try my best to keep it short. A variable
is like a box with a label on it. You can store something inside of the box and label
the box. And whenever you need to retrieve something, you can go find the box with the
right label on it.<br/>
Now, a box may contain one thing like a wedding ring or it could contain many things
like a box with "Kitchen Stuffs" label on it. When a box, contains more than one thing,
we can consider it as an array. To give a glimpse of what a variable with single value
looks like and what a variable array looks like, in _javascript_ it looks like this:

<br />
<SyntaxHighlight
  bahasa='javascript'
  kode={`const weddingRingBox = "wedding ring";
const kitchenStuffsBox = ["Spoon", "Fork", "Oven", "Knife"];`}
/>
<br />
In excel, assuming we store the value of variable `weddingRingBox` in **A1** and
`kitchenStuffsBox` in **A2**, this can be represented as follows:
<br />
<SyntaxHighlight
  bahasa='xlsx'
  kode={`="wedding ring"
={"Spoon","Fork","Oven","Knife"}`}
/>
<br />
In Excel, it looks like this:
<br />
<ImageBlock

    "https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/surreal-assets/artikel/arrays-in-excel/SingleValueArrayEx.png"
  }
  caption={"Cell with single value in A1 and array in A2"}
/>
<br />
Notice the _curly braces_? In programming, we're using _square brackets_ to define
an array, in Excel though, an array is define using _curly braces_ instead.
<br />
How about those _thin border_ that wraps the cells in range **A2:D2**? Those are
what we called as array spill area in Excel. Since an array contains multiple values,
while a cell in Excel can only store exactly only one value, if the output of your
formula is an array, it will spill to adjacent cells.
<br />
By default an array such as <ExcelLine>{`={"Spoon","Fork","Oven","Knife"}`}</ExcelLine>
will spill from left to right (ltr) or on a row based. You can change this default
behavior to spill top to bottom or on a column based by using _TRANSPOSE_ such as
<ExcelLine>{`=TRANSPOSE({"Spoon","Fork","Oven","Knife"})`}</ExcelLine>.
<br />
Also notice that you write the formula only in one cell, which is **A2**, but if
you activate cell **B2**, **C2** or **D2**, you can see that the formula is
still visible in _Formula Bar_ and the formula looks kinda greyed out, and you
can only edit the formula when the active cell is in **A2**. Moreover, if you
write or output something in **B2**, **C2** or **D2**, say we write "Hello!" in
**C2**, then you will get _#SPILL!_ error in **A2**, this is because **C2** has
a value and prevent the array in **A2** to spill its output.
<br />
You can refer to an array in excel from other cell by referring to the top left
first cell of the array and end it with _#_ like in the case above, you can
write <ExcelLine>{`=A2#`}</ExcelLine>
say in **G1** and the array will show up and spill from **G1** to **J1**.
<br />

### Array Index and Element

One special characteristic of array is what we call ***index***, while the value 
inside of an array usually called as an ***element***. Let's go back to the example 
of array in _typescript_ previously, with a bit of interactivity to try for 
yourself (expect an error in output when you delete the number between square brackets, 
this is okay, just type 0, 1, 2 or 3):
<br/>
<Spack namaFile='/App.tsx' template='react-ts' denganPreview>
  {`const App = () => {
  const kitchenStuffs: string[] = ["Spoon", "Fork", "Oven", "Knife"];

  return (
    /\*
      Try changing the number inside the square brackets,
      say kitchenStuffs[0] to kitchenStuffs[2]
      Note: In programming world, index start from 0, so
      kitchenStuffs maximum index number is 3
    \*/
    <span>You choose: {kitchenStuffs[0]}</span> // kitchenStuffs[0] should return Spoon
  )
}

export default App;`}
</Spack>
<br/>
As can be seen above, we can refer to the ***first element*** in `kitchenStuffs` by 
writing `kitchenStuffs[0]`, and to refer to the ***third element*** by writing 
`kitchenStuffs[2]`. In programming, an _index_ start from 0, the same cannot be said 
for Excel. In Excel, the _index_ start at 1.
<br/>

### Multi Universe, err Dimension Array!

In programming lingo, we define the size of an array as _shape_ or _dimension_, so 
the previous example of array in Excel is to be said of having _dimension_ of ***1x4*** 
or ***shape(1, 4)*** (in Python lingo!)
<br/>
Let's not limit ourself with an array that contains only 1 row and 4 columns, like 
what is being shown on previous Excel example. If an array could contain multiple 
values inside of it, why not the values itself is also an array, so its an array 
inside of another array. 
<br/>
**HOLD ON TIGHT!** Because we're going to venture into the world of multi dimensional array!
