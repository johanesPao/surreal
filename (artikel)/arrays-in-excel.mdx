Before we dwelve into arrays formulas in Excel, we need to talk about some of the
more basic stuff, like what is an array? why would we need it in excel? is array a
new features in excel? does it important to learn about it? and how does it work?

## I What is an Array?

First, we need to talk about what most people in the world of programming addressed
as _variable_, it's a bit off-track, but I'll try my best to keep it short. A variable
is like a box with a label on it. You can store something inside of the box and label
the box. And whenever you need to retrieve something, you can go find the box with the
right label on it.<br/>
Now, a box may contain one thing like a wedding ring or it could contain many things
like a box with "Kitchen Stuffs" label on it. When a box, contains more than one thing,
we can consider it as an array. To give a glimpse of what a variable with single value
looks like and what a variable array looks like, in _javascript_ it looks like this:

<br />
<SyntaxHighlight
  bahasa='javascript'
  kode={`const weddingRingBox = "wedding ring";
const kitchenStuffsBox = ["Spoon", "Fork", "Oven", "Knife"];`}
/>
<br />
In excel, assuming we store the value of variable `weddingRingBox` in **A1** and
`kitchenStuffsBox` in **A2**, this can be represented as follows:
<br />
<SyntaxHighlight
  bahasa='xlsx'
  kode={`="wedding ring"
={"Spoon","Fork","Oven","Knife"}`}
/>
<br />
In Excel, it looks like this:
<br />

  }
  caption={"Cell with single value in A1 and array in A2"}
/>
<br />
Notice the _curly braces_? In programming, we're using _square brackets_ to define
an array, in Excel though, an array is define using _curly braces_ instead.
<br />
How about those _thin border_ that wraps the cells in range **A2:D2**? Those are
what we called as array spill area in Excel. Since an array contains multiple values,
while a cell in Excel can only store exactly only one value, if the output of your
formula is an array, it will spill to adjacent cells.
<br />
By default an array such as <ExcelLine>{`={"Spoon", "Fork", "Oven", "Knife"}`}</ExcelLine>
will spill from left to right (ltr) or on a row based. You can change this default
behavior to spill top to bottom or on a column based by using _TRANSPOSE_ such as
<ExcelLine>{`=TRANSPOSE({"Spoon", "Fork", "Oven", "Knife"})`}</ExcelLine>.
<br />
Also notice that you write the formula only in one cell, which is **A2**, but if
you activate cell **B2**, **C2** or **D2**, you can see that the formula is
still visible in _Formula Bar_ and the formula looks kinda greyed out, and you
can only edit the formula when the active cell is in **A2**. Moreover, if you
write or output something in **B2**, **C2** or **D2**, say we write "Hello!" in
**C2**, then you will get _#SPILL!_ error in **A2**, this is because **C2** has
a value and prevent the array in **A2** to spill its output.
<br />
You can refer to an array in excel from other cell by referring to the top left
first cell of the array and end it with _#_ like in the case above, you can
write <ExcelLine>{`=A2#`}</ExcelLine>
say in **G1** and the array will show up and spill from **G1** to **J1**.
<br />

### I.1 Array Index and Element

One special characteristic of array is what we call ***index***, while the value 
inside of an array usually called as an ***element***. Let's go back to the example 
of array in _typescript_ previously, with a bit of interactivity to try for 
yourself (expect an error in output when you delete the number between square brackets, 
this is okay, just type 0, 1, 2 or 3):
<br/>
<Spack namaFile='/App.tsx' template='react-ts' denganPreview>
  {`const App = () => {
  const kitchenStuffs: string[] = ["Spoon", "Fork", "Oven", "Knife"];

  return (
    /\*
      Try changing the number inside the square brackets,
      say kitchenStuffs[0] to kitchenStuffs[2]
      Note: In programming world, index start from 0, so
      kitchenStuffs maximum index number is 3
    \*/
    <span>You choose: {kitchenStuffs[0]}</span> // kitchenStuffs[0] should return Spoon
  )
}

export default App;`}
</Spack>
<br/>
As can be seen above, we can refer to the ***first element*** in `kitchenStuffs` by 
writing `kitchenStuffs[0]`, and to refer to the ***third element*** by writing 
`kitchenStuffs[2]`. In programming, an _index_ start from 0, the same cannot be said 
for Excel. In Excel, the _index_ start at 1.
<br/>

### I.2 Multi Universe, err Dimensionional Array!

In programming lingo, we define the size of an array as _shape_ or _dimension_, so 
the previous example of array in Excel is to be said of having _dimension_ of ***1x4*** 
or ***shape(1, 4)*** (in Python lingo!)
<br/>
Let's not limit ourself with an array that contains only 1 row and 4 columns, like 
what is being shown on previous Excel example. If an array could contain multiple 
values inside of it, why not the values itself is also an array, so its an array 
inside of another array. 
<br/>
**HOLD ON TIGHT!** Because we're going to venture into the world of multi dimensional 
array!
<br/>
In data science or mathematical terms especially in linear algebra, there are mathematical
objets known as _scalar, vector, matrix_ and _tensor_. Think of _scalar_ (also known as 
zero rank tensor) as an object that contains single value like Excel's cell. _Vector_ (also 
known as first rank tensor) is an object that contains multiple values, this is equals to 
our previous example of array in Excel with dimension 1x4. Matrix (also known as second 
rank tensor) is an object that is composed of multiple arrays that in overall shape a 
rectangular array with dimension such as 4x5. While tensor is an object that may contains
an infinite number of arrays and may represent three dimensional space and above (discussion
about this shape is out of the scope of this writing, and by limitation, Excel can't simulate
this shape either, so we will stick to matrix on next section)
<br/>
When you're working with Excel array formulas, you will need to be able to think in the scope
of at least an array inside of another array, because most of our data or output will be in 
this kind of form. To extend on our last example of `kitchenStuffs` example, imagine, for
whatever reason God knows, the things inside of the box was laid out like this
<br/>
<ImageBlock 
  url={`https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/surreal-assets/artikel/arrays-in-excel/ArrayInArray.png`}
  caption={`two dimensional array in excel`}
/>
<br/>
This can be achieved by writing the following formula <ExcelLine>{`={"Spoon", "Fork", "Oven", "Knife", "Sauce Pan"; "Tea", "Sugar", "Salt", "Wok", "Mixing Bowl"; "Glass", "Plate", "MSG", "Skillet", "Colander"; "Cutting Board", "Whisk", "Spatula", "Toaster", "Blender"}`}</ExcelLine>
<br />
<BlockQuote

  judul='Excel Regional Format Setting' 
  konten={
`Note that your regional format setting maybe different than the regional format being used 
in this writing. You may need to switch \`,\` for \`;\` and vice versa on some regional 
format. 
<br />
For more information, refers to your operating system Regional and Language settings.
`}
/>
<br />
Notice how I separate each line of array using separator `;`? Now we have four values inside 
of **A1**, separated by `;`, but each value out of those four values in **A1** is also an 
array itself. In data science terms, one array or vector, usually represent 1 event out of 
some samples. This also in line with the spirit of how data should be represented in a 
_tabular_ fashion, whether in Excel or in any kind of data processing tools or storage.
<br /> 
Well, actually my last example didn't respect any principle of _tabular_ data, basically
because I just want to show an example of dimension of array as a collection of kitchen 
stuffs. But most of the time, your data may look more like this
<br />
<ImageBlock
  url={`https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/surreal-assets/artikel/arrays-in-excel/TabularArray.png`}
  caption={`tabular data`}
/>
<br />
Where the first column represent items, the second column may represent weight in _grams_, 
third columns may represent the material it was made of, fourth column is year it is being
made, and the last column may define whether the item has rust on it or not.
<br />

### I.3 Array Indexing and Slicing

Now that you know that an array in Excel could have one dimension or two dimension 
(theoretically, it could be infinite dimension, but Excel has limitation for that), how to
call your array as a whole or in part to be calculated in another function or to be 
outputted? With regards to the special characteristic of an array that has been discussed 
in I.1, we can call an array as whole by writing <ExcelLine>{`=A1#`}</ExcelLine> (this is
also already mentioned on the last part of part I) in any other cells, or if we want only
some part of the array itself, we could do _slicing_ by _index_. Below are some examples
of _slicing_ on _index_
<br />
<ImageBlock
  url={`https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/surreal-assets/artikel/arrays-in-excel/ArrayIndexingSlicing.png`}
  caption={`examples of indexing and slicing of array in Excel`}
/>
<br />
The first example shows how to extract one element from an array by using index intersection
such as <ExcelLine>{`=INDEX(A1#, 2, 3)`}</ExcelLine> to return the element at row 2 and 
column 3. `INDEX()` takes 3 arguments, in which 2 are required and the last one is optional.
The first argument of `INDEX()` ask for the array that you want to look up for (in our example
above is **A1#**), the second argument ask for what number of row do you want to get from the 
array in first argument (in our example this is `2` for second row), and the last optional 
argument is the number of column that you want to get from the array (in our example this is 
`3` for third column). Given these arguments in the example, `INDEX()` formula will return
`Salt` as the element of the array that is located in second row and third column.
<br />
Though, `INDEX()` is not limited to returning one element only. In the second example of 
<ExcelLine>{`=INDEX(A1#,2,0)`}</ExcelLine>, almost all the arguments are the same as previous
example, except for the column argument which is on this example is `0`, this means that we 
are only want to return the element on the array based on its row, which is `2` in the 
formula and that's it. You can also write <ExcelLine>{`=INDEX(A1#,2,)`}</ExcelLine>, notice
how I wrote it `,)`, this will give you the same output as `,0)`. Instead of a single value 
like the first example above, this formula will return you an array instead, an array of 
elements in the second row of array **A1#** that is.
<br />
You can also do the same to return elements of array based on its column by using 
<ExcelLine>{`=INDEX(A1#,0,5)`}</ExcelLine>. This is exactly the same as the second example 
above, but instead of `,2,0)` we use `,0,5)` in this third example to return the fifth 
column of an two dimensional array disregarding its row. And yes, instead of `,0,5)` you 
can also write it as `,,5)` just like before.
<br />
You can also gives an array in the argument for row and column (second and third argument)
of a `INDEX()` formula as shown in the last example which look a bit complex. <ExcelLine>{`=INDEX(A1#,TRANSPOSE({1,2,3}), {2,4,5})`}</ExcelLine>.
What this last example is trying to do is actually to return the first, second and third rows
on the second, fourth and fifth columns of an array. Notice how it ignores the third column
and jump from second to fourth column. You can pick the row and column that you want to return
from an array, you can even use array to indicate the selection of rows and columns that 
you want to return. In the last example it is quite clear that `{2, 4, 5}` refer to second,
fourth and fifth column as it is also returning `Fork, Knife, Sauce Pan` and then 
`Sugar, Wok, Mixing Bowls`, it is indeed returning the second, fourth and fifth column. But 
how about the rows that we choose? Why would we wrapped it in another formula of `TRANSPOSE()`?
Remember! When you wrote `{1, 2, 3}` this in turn will output an array horizontally, from left 
to right, what else is being presented horizontally from left to right? Yes, columns. So if
you wrote the argument for rows in `INDEX()` as `{1, 2, 3}`, you will get unexpected result
that will actually return the elements in coordinates `(1,2), (2,4), (3,5)` which is `Fork,
Wok, Colander`. If you really want to return the first, second and third rows without using
`TRANSPOSE()` you should write it as, <ExcelLine>{`=INDEX(A1#,{1;2;3},{2,4,5})`}</ExcelLine>
instead. Notice the `;` separator, remember what this separator present in array? Yes, rows.
<br />
If it still feels hard to grasp this concept, feel free to take another round of reading, 
and what important is, to try it yourself, experiment out.

_I will wrote more later on..., stay tuned!_
