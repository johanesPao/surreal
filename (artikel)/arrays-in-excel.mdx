### The Journey

If I were to reminisce back to the days when I first introduced to Excel, or even its predecessor,
Lotus123, it must've been way back around 1995. My first experience with excel began
in 2009 when I started working as a Junior Financial Analyst at a Consulting Firm. Working in a consulting firm
with clients from various industries, be it telecommunication, logistics, palm oil,
etc, required me to be open minded and put my feet on their shoes in order for me to understand
their unique business process, their _SWOT_, the competition within their industries, rivals and foes,
as well as industry specific regulations.

<br />
Most of the time, we were conducting _Feasibility Study_ for clients. However, being
the _new kid_ in the company, given that _analysis_ is their main course. Most of
the _financial modelling_ has been designed in excel even before I joined the company.
So there wasn't much room for improvisation, but I couldn't resist the chance to
break down the Excel files and understand how things worked logically.
<br />
In 2013, I finally had the opportunity to pioneer multiple Excel models for a financing
company that is part of PT Japfa Comfeed Tbk. I joined the company as a _Financial
Analyst and Accounting Supervisor_, working directly under the CFO and being responsible
for creating _financial modelling_ for business scenarios or significant capital
expenditure, such as building a _corn dryer plant_. But that's not all, as an Accounting
Supervisor, I was also responsible for consolidating Quarterly and Yearly Financial
Reports for five subsidiaries and ensuring timely reporting to regulation institution
such as OJK and international investors (usually a _joint venture_ companies).
<br />
See, I have a bad habit to get overly focused on my train of thought and go off track
when telling stories, as you can see from the paragraphs above. Enough about me,
back to the topic. What I'm trying to convey is, that I've had my fair share of experience
with Excel, its ups and downs, and those moments of "Huh? How come it turns to these?".
<br />

### Arrays, Keeping Things in Line!

On this ocassion though, I want to talk about arrays. In excel. Yes, arrays has actually
been in excel for a long time. Remember those days when you could create an array with `Shift+Ctrl+Enter`
on a formula in a cell, and Excel would wrap your formula in curly braces like this <ExcelLine>{`={SUMIFS(A:A) & " pieces"}`}</ExcelLine>
That's an array.

<br />
Now what is an array? An array in a one-line definition is a variable that contains
multiple values inside of it. So, in the lingo of tech and data side, you can imagine
creating a variable called _numOfSheeps_ that holds an integer value, say 12. In
programming language, say _typescript_ this is written as:
<br />
<SyntaxHighlight bahasa='typescript' kode={`let numOfSheeps = 12`} />
<br />
In Excel universe, each cell in a sheet can be viewed as a variable. So when you
write **12** in cell **A1**, its like saying:
<br />
<SyntaxHighlight bahasa='typescript' kode={`let A1 = 12`} />
<br />
Or better yet, use **Formulas > Name Manager > New...** and fills the **Name** with
_numOfSheeps_ and **Refers to** _'Sheet1'!\$A$1_, this will enables you to write <ExcelLine>{`=numOfSheeps`}</ExcelLine>
in any cells, and it will gives you the value of **A1** which is **12**, just like
we did in _typescript_.
<br />
_More to come..._
