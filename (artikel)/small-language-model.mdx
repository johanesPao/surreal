A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) program 
that can recognize and generate text, among other tasks. LLMs are trained on huge sets of 
data — hence the name "large."<br/>
<br/>
LLMs are built on machine learning: specifically, a type of neural network called a transformer 
model.<br/>
<br/>
In simpler terms, an LLM is a computer program that has been fed enough examples to be able 
to recognize and interpret human language or other types of complex data. 
Many LLMs are trained on data that has been gathered from the Internet — thousands or 
millions of gigabytes' worth of text. 
But the quality of the samples impacts how well LLMs will learn natural language, 
so an LLM's programmers may use a more curated data set.<br/>
<br/>
LLMs use a type of machine learning called deep learning in order to understand how characters, 
words, and sentences function together. Deep learning involves the probabilistic analysis 
of unstructured data, which eventually enables the deep learning model to recognize 
distinctions between pieces of content without human intervention.<br/>
<br/>
LLMs are then further trained via tuning: they are fine-tuned or prompt-tuned to the particular task that the programmer wants them to do, such as interpreting questions and generating responses, or translating text from one language to another.<br/>
